To your GitHub assignment for arrays,  add subroutines to
1) Create a tuple that can hold the following details about a student.  Enter values using readlines and then output its values
ID
First name
Surname
Tutor
Age
Modify your program so it is an array of tuples (records),  prompt the user as to how many records (elements) are in the db table (array)
Add a for loop to allow the user to enter all the records one at a time

Add another for loop to output all the table values 

2) Create the program so that it has an array of student records (same structure).  You can pre-initialize in your program with values if you wish to save time.  Allow the user to search the "Database" using the student ID and return the correct values
